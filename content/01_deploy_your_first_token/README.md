# Proof of Learn (POL) 3 Template

Welcome to the **Proof of Learn 3 Template**! This template serves as your starting point for creating engaging and interactive learning content for the POL platform. All the content and resources you need can be found [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/5208980/pol-template).

## Getting Started

All sections and guides in this template are created as Markdown files within the `/content` folder. This makes it easy to customize and expand upon the provided content as you build your own quests and learning resources.

The template comes with a pre-configured quest structure. The quest configuration file can be found [here](https://github.com/5208980/pol-template/blob/master/quest.config.json). Feel free to modify it to fit your specific needs.

### Explore the Template on POL

Once youâ€™ve added your content, you can test it directly on POL. The platform's integrated IDE allows users to complete quests or alternatively use tools like Remix or Foundry.

### Structure of the Template

- **01_deploy_your_first_token**:  
  This is where users will begin their journey. It contains a step-by-step guide on deploying their first token, with two main quests:
  - **05_deploy**: This section walks users through deploying a smart contract. The goal is for users to create and deploy a contract, providing the transaction hash as proof. As a creator, you'll need to ensure your guide has clear instructions, including details about deploying to the correct blockchain and using the correct contract format.
  - **06_set**: Here, users will interact with their deployed contract by invoking a method or performing a transaction. The transaction hash will verify their success. Again, your guidance as a creator will be crucial to ensure users can correctly complete this task.
  
- **02_tokens_using_openzeppelin**:  
  This section covers deploying tokens using the popular `@openzeppelin` library. The quest in this section is more advanced, as it requires users to understand how to use external libraries to create and deploy smart contracts.
